# Auto-text-completion

This is a simple html page which uses JS for backend work, I'm using openAI API and their text completion model for this.

**You have to add your own API key in line 18 of script.js. It should look like this
'Authorization': 'Bearer <API KEY>' 
Remove <> after entering the API key and you are good to go.
