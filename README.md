# Auto-text-completion

This is a simple html page which uses JS for backend work, I'm using openAI API and their text completion model for this.

**You have to add your own API key in line 18 of script.js. It should look like this**

'Authorization': 'Bearer API KEY' 

Replace API KEY with your actual key and you are good to goo.
